This week we met for our project discussion and since we have already segregated the work. Everyone was working on his own task and discussing the idea and explaining what he was doing. This makes the team work towards the same goal. We also had knowledge sharing session, in which other team members helped when I was stuck at some point. The framework is new to me, and I really appreciate that the team is working together and helping. At the end it is team synchronization and learning which matters.
I continued to work on backend server code for enhancing the user login functionality. Initially, the design for creating a login for user was by taking inputs like user name, email, password etc. But as we developed, we realized we need to put restrictions for registering only once with an email id. After successfully implementing and testing that feature, I am continuing to work on developing services for Binary test game. This service will fetch the question from database and display it to user. Second service is for capturing the response from user and saving in database. Third service is to find the score and updating the scoreboard depending on the scores of the user. I am still working on it since we need to analyze how the scoreboard will be updated. Will it be refreshed every time the user submits the test or it will be refreshed only when a user clicks on the link to view scoreboard.
Developing a Simple application is not same as developing an Easy application. The application should be simple enough for kids to understand the logic of Binary number at the same time interesting and compelling enough for them to challenge themselves of their understanding.
