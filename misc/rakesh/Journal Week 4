Core Value: Feedback:
====================
- Updates
  We have divided the whole work into the a category of top-level features. After that we have 
  divided the work in terms of back-end and front-end. For this week, the back-end team decided to 
  design a REST end-point.This REST endpoint will use mongo as the database.This database will hold
  several collections like quiz-questions, user-info, etc.
  
  My individual contribution in last week was to design the nodejs based REST server 
  which will connect to mongo and allow all the REST calls like (GET, POST, DELETE).
  We created a database called questions, which has a bunch of game questions.
  Each question has a field called 'level', which indicates wheter it is an 'easy', 'moderate'
  or 'tough' question. While storing a question into the database we manually decide the level
  and feed into the DB. While fetching the question as per the level, the REST endpoint has to be queried 
  as: http://localhost:5000/game?level=<easy|moderate|tough>. This REST endpoint is up and running
  and we are currently testing it and intergrating it with remote mongo.
  
  
  
- Exhibition of the Core Value:
  After I have finished the REST end-point design, I have called for a peer review session, where all of
  us went through the code.After the discussion we came out with numerous best-practises and use-cases
  we never have thought of before.The team-member who is designing the mongo framework told me how exatly
  she wants the REST endpoint to be. Based on all these inputs I designed the second version of the 
  REST end-point. This second version is
   - much more mature than the first one. 
   - It handles more functional and non-functinal cases (scalibility, static analysis etc). 
   - It also handles edge-cases better than the first version.
  
  Clearly the review discussion where the feedbacks are shared and valued are very 
  helpful and productive.It really helped us increase the quality of our design and meet the
  requirements more correctly.
  
  In another instance, where one of the team members was designing the database in mysql, we suggested
  her to do it in mongodb. She took the feedback positively and started a healthy discussion. We debated
  and exchanged ideas, provided her lots of reviews about the pros and cons of nosql vs mysql. At the
  end of the discussion she clearly understood what is the best for the project. In a feedback-based
  system, the receiving end is as much as important as the sending end. In this instance, she clearly
  has shown the positive attitude to take a feedback and do a value judgement for the purposes of the 
  project.This is another good exhibition of the xp core value 'feedback'
