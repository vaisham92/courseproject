UPDATES:
=======
This week I have designed a login app that implements the bloew modules:
 - login local
 - login facebook
 - login google
 - session management remote
 
These are designed using node.js, passport.js, express.js and bootstrap.I have created
a node module called gamelogin that will initialize and provide the above mentioned features.
It has dependancies on other standard node modules mentioned in the package.json.
For local login, the app creates a user collection in the mongodb, using the mongoose 
client. The register module allows the user to create the credentials. Local login 
ensures that the the user is authenticated as per this database.For this we used
passport-local strategy.
For Facebook & Google login I have used passport-facebook and passport-google strategy.
In both the cases I had to create an appID in the facebook and google. It gave me
a authentication ID and key which is used in the login app. This ensures that our
login app is allowed to use the Facebook and Google login database.
Passport.js helps to maintain the session.

XP Value (Feedback):
===================
This week we have setup demonstration of indovidual work so far. Everybody was assigned
some time to demonstrate his/her work along with code walkthrough. Then we brainstormed 
and provided feedback to the module owners. This not only helped the module owners
verify the correctness of their work, but also made the team aware of the current health 
of the project, burning blockers and any redundant work if any. All the team members
took the fedback constructively.And we decided to have one further round of demonstration
after incorporating the changes.One of the module owners made the design little complex.
A demonstration in front of the team and a follow-up demonstration really made the design 
very simple and reduced the complexity. This peer review session increased the overall quality 
of our app and I believe this is an excellent exhibition of the XP Core value feedback. 
Since we have reached the end phase of the project, we have decided to increase the
frequency of this demo and peer-review sessions. This will ensure that the module owners are on 
the right track, we meet the deadlines and we deliver and absolutely quality product.This XP value
is now one of the most crucial points at this phase.
