Core value: Courage

This week is the final week for all of us. We had an excellent stretch of eight weeks were we had lot of fruitful discussions, some mostly based on R&D for the project while some where based on a design decisions. Overall it was lot helpful to follow the agile methodologies and XP core values in our discussions to have a good understanding and productive work.

This week was the last week and hence we were spending a lot of time on integrating all the work done and doing the testing. A bunch of test cases were generated by me and Vimal. We enumerated all the possibilities and came up with an exhaustive list of test cases. These cover almost all aspects of our system. Also, during the test case execution we faced bugs and it was left to us whether we will continue with the bug fix or not. Thus we had discussions over this as we were about to ship a product. So our team showed a lot of courage during these meetings and helped us well. We had good number of bugs that we fixed as a part of our bug fixing. The game flow was flawless and we are hopeful of winning the prize and making this an open source contribution by winning the MIT license prize. Also, we have implemented the design patterns as a part of one design pattern for one student rule. We had good understanding of all the design patterns and the different scenarios that can be addressed or the more number of features that can be added for future works. The front end part was done by me and Ashna where we did the HTMLs, JS - angularJs controllers, Ajax libraries, JQuery Effects etc. The backend part was done by Neha, Vimal and Rakesh. They worked on various modules like Database layer, Authentication, Rest apis, single sign on etc. Overall we are happy with our progress and work.
