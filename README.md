Game introduction 
-----------------
Binary digit is the fundamental unit of information. BLA (aka Binary Learning Application) is a simple yet interesting application which  helps school children learn binary numbers.
The application also tests your knowledge of how fast you can convert a decimal  number into binary. Group challenges facilities a common ground for students	to compete among  themselves and find out their performance. BLA also maintains a hall of fame scoreboard which shows the students with good  scores in terms of accuracy and calculation time.
